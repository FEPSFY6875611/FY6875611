      <pre>
        Since the inception of medicine, diagnosing diseases in patients usually involved (and still involves) some form of screening. In ancient times
        we examined the patient on what we merely could observe - symptons, physical abnormalities and pulse readings to name a few. Thanks to advancements
        in medicine and technology, we are now able to examine patients through MRI scans, X-rays and electrocardiograms amongst a plethora of other methods.
        It is indeed ironic that the breakthrough discussed in this conference article links back to the need to observe with our eyes, not with machines. We 
        are not only able to examine what we see on the surface of our body, but are now able to see through it; see inside ourselves with our very own eyes,
        not with a machine shooting x-rays at us. This breakthrough opens new opportunities in the field of medicine; it makes it easier to identify symptoms 
        in patients who aren't able to communicate their issues, such as babies and persons in a vegetative state. But this also extends to diagnosis of animals, 
        no communication is required to identify abnormalities, vets can just examinethe insides of the animals merely by observation. Not only does it impact 
        diagnosis, but also the study and research of diseases within medicine. Students will be able to examine the inner workings of living animals in vivo (still alive), 
        without having to dissect them after death. Scientists are also able to research the nature of diseases such as the spread of cancer in living animals<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
        and study the affect of drugs on the body.
